# Readme

###### "If you can't lick 'em, jine 'em" - James Eli Watson

Full readme will be added in future along with a docker build including CLI for easy config. Suggest you don't use without fully understanding and on a VPS with a burner wallet.

Basic idea is:
- Put a private key and address in a .env file
- Fill out /files/contracts.json with the NFT contract

## ENV File Example:
keys = '["KEY", "KEY2"]'

wallet_addresses = '["MATCHING_ADDRESS", "MATCHING_ADDRESS2"]'
