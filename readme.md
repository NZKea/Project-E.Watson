###### "If you can't lick 'em, jine 'em" - James Eli Watson

A bot to mint avax NFT contracts, which can be triggered either by allowlist timer (Joepegs) or a contract function boolean changing. 

## Running
The most up to date version is on the CLI branch.  Can config with ```python3 main.py wallets``` and ```python3 main.py contracts```. At the moment you would have to create a .env first.  Then you can ```python3 main.py start```.  If you want the solid base the master branch works well.

I am working on an new product which is consuming my time for now.  If you are interested in the NFT bot scene but perhaps cannot run this yourself keep an eye out.


## ENV File Example:
keys = '["KEY", "KEY2"]'

wallet_addresses = '["MATCHING_ADDRESS", "MATCHING_ADDRESS2"]'
